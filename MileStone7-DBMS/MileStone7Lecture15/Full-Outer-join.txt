// here we learn about that:Full-outer-join:

=> what is Full-outer-join:this returns a resulting table that contains all the data when there is a match  on left or right table data.it can be implemented using the (UNION) operation:

// for example:if we have two tables:
1 = account;
2 = transactions;
// It basically works:with the (UNION) operation:
// so we have to (emulate) the (left join UNION right join):


# here we have (left) join:
SELECt a.*,t.* FROM account a left join transaction t ON t.account_id = a.id

# here we put (union) operation between them:
UNION

# herer we have (right) join:
SELECT a.*,t.* from account a right join transaction t ON t.account_id = a.id;
