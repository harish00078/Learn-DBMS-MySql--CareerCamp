// here we learn that:how can we use the (left) join:
=> (left) join is basically the one of the (type) of the (outer) join:
=> what is (left) join: this returns a resulting table that all the data from the left table and the matched data from the right table:

=> syntax of (left) join:

SELECT * FROM TableA left join TableB on TableA.column1 = TableB.column1;


=> use of (left) join:
=> for example if we have (two) tables:
=> transaction and account table: then how can we (implement) the (left) join (query) on these tables:


=> here we write (query):for these two tables:
# note = we can get all the elements or columns of the (particular) table:with the help of (.*):
# note = for defining (character) to the (particular) table:we also have did not have to use the (AS)  keyword:we can simple write (account a):

SELECT a.*,t.* FROM account a left join transaction ON a.id = t.account_id;



=> how can we solve the (query) through the (left) join:
=> for example:if we have to list out all accounts having transaction done between 2020-01-01 to 2021-01-01;

SELECT a.*,t.* FROM account a left join transaction ON a.id = t.account_id WHERE t.date between '2020-01-01' and '2020-01-01';
