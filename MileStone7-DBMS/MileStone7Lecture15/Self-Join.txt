// here we learn about the (self) join:
=> what is (self) join:it is used to get the output from a particular table when the same table is (joined) to itself:or we can say it is basically use when we want the output from the (currently) using table In from of (table):

=>syntax of (self) join:

SELECT A.col_1,B.col_2 FROM TableA A,tableA B where A.col_name =B.col_name AND <condition>;


// for example: if  we have a (table):
1 = account:

SELECT a1.id, a2.balance FROM account as a1 Inner join account as a2 ON a1.id = a2.id;
