// learn about (FILTERING):
=> if we are simply getting the data from the database's (table):
=> then this type of execution is know as (Resultset):
=> but if put some (condition) on that (execution) statement or we say  on that (query):then that is know as (FILTERING):
=> definition of FILTERING: SQL filters are used to (get) a specific subset of the data iteams from the database:the filters is an SQL (WHERE) clause that provides a set of comparisons that must be true in order for a data iteams to be returned:
=> if we only want the bank (braches) those had a (address) of (delhi):
=> for that we can use (filter) in our (query):with the help of (WHERE) function: 

// OPERETORS:
=> for repersenting (AFTER) through operators we can use the greater than (>) operator;
=> for repersenting (BEFORE) through operators we can use the less than (<) operator;


// types of (FILTERING) operators:

=> 1 = (IN) operator:the (IN) operator allows us to specifying multiple values in a (WHERE) clause.we can use multiple (OR) operators in the place of (IN) operator as well:

=> 2 = (NOT-IN) operator: NOT-IN operator is the same as (IN) operator in syntax and it just negates the conditional:Means that (NOT-IN) operator will return (true) for only conditionals which are false for (IN) operator:basically (NOT-IN) operator work opposite to the (In) operator:

=> 3 = (IS-NULL) operator: the (IS-NULL) operator is used to test for (EMPTY-VALUES) or we can say for (NULL-VALUES):

=> 4 = (IS-NOT-NULL) operator: It is used to check for (non-EMPTY) values:
