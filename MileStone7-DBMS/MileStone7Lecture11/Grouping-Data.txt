// here we learn about the (GROUPING-DATA):
=> meaning of (GROUPING-DATA):GROUPING in sql is done by using (GROUP By) function or statement:
=>(GROUP By) statement GROUPS rows that have the same values into the (one) rows or we can say into the (summary) rows:
=> after using the (GROUP BY) clause,all the rows with the same values of the specified columns name will get summarized into a single row:


=> we have (AGGREGATE) functions: for (GROUPING-DATA) in my (My-Sql):
=> what are (AGGREGATE) functions: these are used to perform calculations on multiple values of a columns and return the result into a single value:
=> types of (AGGREGATE) functions are:
=> 1 = (COUNT()):- the number of rows retuned based on condition:for counting a particular value of (column) if it repeat again and again:
=> 2 = (AVG()):- the average of the value is retuned in the selected column:
=> 3 = (MAX()):- the maximum value of a column is returned:
=> 4 = (MIN()):- the minimum value of a column is returned:
=> 5 = (SUM()):- the sum  of the values in  a specified column is returned:

=> general form of writing (GROUP BY) query:
# SELECT column_name(s) FROM T_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s):

=> IMP = if we want to get  a (particular) value from the (GROUP BY) query: FOR that we can use the another (keyword) named as (HAVING):
