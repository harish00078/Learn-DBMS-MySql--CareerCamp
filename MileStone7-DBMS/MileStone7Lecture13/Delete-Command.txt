# here we learn about the another (DML) operation:

// DELETE:it used to perform the (DELETE) operation on the (existing) table or database:

=>  syntax for (DELETE) the one-row:

DELETE from account WHERE balance = "200";

=> syntax for (DELETE) all the rows from the table:
-> 1 = this will only  (DELETE) the  rows of the (table) or we can say that the (data) of the (table):not the (table) itself:
-> 2 = table will still remains there for the (further) use:

DELETE from account;


# there is another way:to delete the  (data) or (rows) in the (table or database):
// if we want to delete the (row) from the (table) through the(column):
// then we have to (disabled) the (safe-mode):
=> syntax for disabling (safe-mode) is:

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

// after disabling (safe-mode):know we can delete the (row) from the (table) through the (column):

=> example:

DELETE from Insurance_tamp1 WHERE year_of_launch  = "2020";


//  after  deleting that (row):know we can again (enabled) the safe-mode:
=> syntax for (enabling) the (safe-mode):

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
