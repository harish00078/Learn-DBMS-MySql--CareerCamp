// here we see that who we can work on the  (delete) and (update) cascade:

=> for that first we have to create the two (tables):


// here we create our (first) table:

=> first table is (Insurance):

create table Insurance(
  product_id Int,
  customer_id Int,
  product_name varchar(10),
  product_type varchar(10),
  year_of_launch year,
  product_value decimal(10,3),
  PRIMARY KEY(product_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(customer_id)  REFEERENCES customer(id)
);

=> select * from customer;
=> select * from Insurance;

# here we update something: on (customer)table or we can call it (parent) table: and that will be show on the (insurance) table or we can call it (child) table as well:
update customer SET id=33 where id = 3;


# here we delete something: on (customer)table or we can call it (parent) table: and that will be show on the (insurance) table as well or we can call it (child) table as well:
delete from customer where id = 33;
