1 = for queries In database. we have two keywords:
a =  (SELECT): use for if we want to select something from the (database):

SELECT < set the table column names>
=> we can select the (multiple) tables;using comma (,):like this:
SELECT <column1,column2>



b = (FROM): here we have to tell or define the (table-name):
