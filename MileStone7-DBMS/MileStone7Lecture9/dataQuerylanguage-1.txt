1 = for do  queries In database. we have two keywords:
a =  (SELECT): use for if we want to select something from the (database):

=> syntax for (SELECT) keywords:
SELECT < set the table column names>
=> we can select the (multiple) tables;using comma (,):like this:
SELECT <column1,column2>
=> if we have thousands of or millions of (columns) in the particular (table):for accessing them all directly:we can use the (*):
SELECT * FROM student;



b = (FROM): here we have to tell or define the (table-name):

=> syntax of from is:

FROM <table-name>;



// correct order of using (keywords) for (queries-execution):
// or we can say how the (query) system execute the (query):
1 = first we use the (FROM):
2 = then we use the (SELECT):


// can we use (SELECT) keywords without referring tables/ without using (FROM) clause:
=> we do this with the help of (Dual-tables):

=> definition of Dual-tables: Dual tables are dummy tables that are already created by Mysql itself. the significance of dual tables is that we can make temporary changes without disturbing the user-defined tables:

=> you can find the current time of the system, can perform mathematical calculations using dual tables,convert the string form lower-case to upper-case and vise-versa,etc:

=> Imp = dual-tables have so many inbuild operation in it:we can use those operations for our (tables):
