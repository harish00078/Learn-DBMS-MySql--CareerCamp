// here we learn about the (ALTER) keyword:
=> ALTER-table:The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
=> The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

=> ALTER-operations:
1 = ADD
2 = CHANGE-column
3 = modify
4 = drop
5 = RENAME


=> how to use the (ALTER) operations:

=> 1 = here we use (add) operation:
# if we want to (add) new (column) in the table:for that we can  use the (add) operation of the (ALTER) keyword:
# syntax for (add) operation:
ALTER TABLE <table-name>
ADD <column-name> <data-type>
# example of (add) operation:
ALTER table insurance
ADD product_details VARCHAR(20)

# => we can also (add) the new table after the particular table if we want:through the (AFTER) KEYWORD:
ALTER table insurance
ADD product_details VARCHAR(20)
after product_type;



=> 2 = here we use (modify) operation:
# if we want to (modify) the  (column) of the table:for that we can  use the (modify) operation of the (ALTER) keyword:
# syntax for (modify) operation:
ALTER TABLE <table-name>
modify column <column-name> <data-type>
# example of (add) operation:
# here we modify the (data-type) length of the (column):
ALTER table insurance
modify product_details VARCHAR(40);


=> 3 = here we use (CHANGE-COLUMN) operation:
# if we want to change the (old) column-name with the (new) column-name:for that we can use the (change-column) operation:
# syntax:
ALTER table <table-name>
CHANGE COLUMN <OLD-COLUMN-NAME> <NEW-COLUMN-NAME> <DATA-TYPE>
# EXAMPLE:
ALTER table insurance
change column product_details p_details VARCHAR(20);

=> 4 = here we use (drop) operation:
# if we want to drop the (column) of the (table) for that we can use the (drop) operation of the (alter) KEYWORD:
# syntax:
ALTER table <table-name>
drop column <column-name>

# for example:
ALTER table insurance
drop column p_details;

=> 5 = here we use (RENAME) operation:
# if we want to rename the (table) or the (column) of the table:for that we can use the (rename) operation:

# example of rename the (table):
ALTER table insurance
rename to  insurance_temp;

# example of rename the (column-name):
