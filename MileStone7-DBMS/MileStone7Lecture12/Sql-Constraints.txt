// here we learn about the (sql) constraints:
=> constraints = constraints are the (rules) that we can apply on the (type of data) in a table:that is, we can specify the limit on the (type of data) that can be stored in a particular (column) in a table using (constraints):

=> there are basically (six) types of (constraints):
1 = (NOT NULL):
2 = (PRIMARY KEY):
3 = (FOREIGN KEY):
4 = (UNIQUE):
5 = (CHECK):
6 = ((DEFAULT):

=> HERE we learn about the last (three):(UNIQUE),(CHECK),(DEFAULT):BECAUSE about the (above three) we already studied about:
1 = (UNIQUE):
