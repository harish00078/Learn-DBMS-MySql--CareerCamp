// here we learn about the (sql) constraints:
=> constraints = constraints are the (rules) that we can apply on the (type of data) in a table:that is, we can specify the limit on the (type of data) that can be stored in a particular (column) in a table using (constraints):

=> there are basically (six) types of (constraints):
1 = (NOT NULL):
2 = (PRIMARY KEY):
3 = (FOREIGN KEY):
4 = (UNIQUE):
5 = (CHECK):
6 = ((DEFAULT):

=> HERE we learn about the last (three):(UNIQUE),(CHECK),(DEFAULT):BECAUSE about the (above three) we already studied about:

1 = (UNIQUE):UNIQUE constraints make sure that all the values in a column which is declared UNIQUE are different: it means that the values in any row of a column must not be repeated:
=> multiple columns in a table can have a UNIQUE constraints:

=> here we have one  (UNIQUE) constraints in a table:
create table customer(
id INT NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
# HERE WE DEFINE THE (ID) AS A (UNIQUE) CONSTRAINTS:
UNIQUE(id)
);

=> here we DEFINE the two constraints in a one table:
create table customer(
id INT NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
# HERE WE DEFINE THE (ID) AND  (NAME) AS (UNIQUE) IN THE (CUSTOMER) TABLE:
CONSTRAINT UNIQUE(id,name)
);


2 = (CHECK): the CHECK is used to put the limitations on the value range that we can put in a column:means that it helps to ensure that the values stored in a column meets a specific condition:

=> here we use the (CHECK) constraints:
create table account(
account_id INT NOT NULL,
balance INT NOT NULL,
customer_id INT NOT NULL,
# here we use the (check) constraint:for giving a condition to the (balance) column:
CHECK (balance >= 3000)
);


3 = (DEFAULT): DEFAULT constraint set a DEFAULT value for a column:means that this constraint specifies a DEFAULT value for the column when no value is specified by the user:

=> here we use (DEFAULT) CONSTRAINTS:
=> let us say for all the accounts we want to have a balance of (100) when an account is added we can make sure of  this by using the (DEFAULT) constraint:basically we gave the DEFAULT value of (100) to every account that we have added:

create table account(
account_id INT NOT NULL,
# HERE WE GAVE THE (DEFAULT) VALUE OF (100) TO EVERY  ACCOUNT:
balance INT DEFAULT 100,
CUSTOMER_ID INT NOT NULL
);

=> we can drop the DEFAULT constraint by using (drop) keyword:
ALTER TABLE ACCOUNT
# here we drop the default:
ALTER balance drop DEFAULT;

=> we can also (sparately) DEFINE the (default) value for a particular (column): with the helps of (ALTER) keyword.with one of its property or we can say its function named as (MODIFY):

ALTER TABLE account
# here we use (alter) keyword's: (modify) property:
MODIFY balance DEFAULT 100;
