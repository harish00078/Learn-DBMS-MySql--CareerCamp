// primary-key: 
=> primary-key helps us to (uniquely-identify) tuples of a relation:it cannnot  be (null) and have (unique) values:
=> each table has only one primary key. but a primary key can have one or more (columns) fields as part of the primary key:

=> way we can create primary key:

=> 1 = we can create primary key with the (column-name):LIKE

# CREATE TABLE People(
  // here we create (primary key) with in the (column):
#   ID INT NOT NULL (primary key),
#   LastName VARCHAR(255),
#   FirstName VARCHAR(255),
#   Address VARCHAR(255),
#   City VARCHAR(30),
# );

=> 2 =  we can create (primary key) in the last of the all (columns):

# CREATE TABLE People(
#   PID INT NOT NULL,
#   LastName VARCHAR(255),
#   FirstName VARCHAR(255),
#   Address VARCHAR(255),
#   City VARCHAR(30),
// here we create (primary key) in the last of all the (columns):
#   PRIMARY KEY (PID)
# );


=> 3 = we can also define (two) primary key in the last of all the (columns):

# CREATE TABLE People(
#   PID INT NOT NULL,
#   People_id INT NOT NULL,
#   LastName VARCHAR(255),
#   FirstName VARCHAR(255),
#   Address VARCHAR(255),
#   City VARCHAR(30),
// here we create or define two primary keys at the end of the all the (columns):
#   PRIMARY KEY (PID,PEOPLE_ID)
# );


=> 4 = we can also define the (primary key) differenlty: after be already (created) a table:

# here we create table:
# CREATE TABLE People(
#   PID INT NOT NULL,
#   LastName VARCHAR(255),
#   FirstName VARCHAR(255),
#   Address VARCHAR(255),
#   City VARCHAR(30),
# );

// here we define the primary key differenlty from the table:with the help of (ALTER) keyword:
# ALTER table people add primary key(PID):

=> 5 = we can also delete the primary key:with the help of (ALTER) keyword:
# we can use the (drop) propery of the (ALTER) keyword: for (deleting) the primary key:

# ALTER TABLE PEOPLE drop primary key;
