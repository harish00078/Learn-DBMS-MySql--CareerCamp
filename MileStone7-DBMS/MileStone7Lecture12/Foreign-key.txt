// foreign key:

=> foreign-key: Foreign Key refers to the Primary Key of another table. Each table can have any number of foreign key(s). Lets us say we have a customer and account table:
=> here we have (customer) table:

# CREATE TABLE customer
# (
# id INT NOT NULL,
# branch_id INT NOT NULL,
# first_name VARCHAR(20),
# last_name VARCHAR(20),
# DOB INT,
# gender CHAR(6),
# PRIMARY KEY(id)
# );

=> here we have (account) table:

# CREATE TABLE account
# (
# id INT NOT NULL,
# balance INT,
# customer_id INT NOT NULL,
# PRIMARY KEY(id),
// here we use (customer_id) as FOREIGN key:because (customer_id) is a primary-key in the (customer) table:
// In customer table (customer_id) is named as (id):
// those (id's) we used as (customer_id) in the (account) table:for creating a (connection) between the two tables: through (primary key) or (foreign key):
# FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer(id) );
