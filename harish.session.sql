--  here we create our first query with the help of (select) or (from) keyword:

-- SELECT name,major from student;


-- here we select all the (columns) from a  particular (table):
-- by simply using (*):

-- SELECT * FROM student;


-- here we only execute the (select) keyword:wihtout any help of the (from) keyword: with the help of (dual-tables):
-- we can execute queries by simply using (select) keywords:
-- but we are only able to (execute) the (real-time) queries:
-- Imp = dual-tables have so many inbuild operation in it:we can use those operations for our (tables):

-- like : here we are adding (two) values:

-- SELECT 1000 + 100;

-- we can also convert the (table) data in the lower-case to upper-case:with the help of (dual-tables) operations:

-- SELECt ucase('coding ninjas');

-- for check date and time we can use:

-- (now) function:
-- SELECT NOW();


-- we can also use (date-time) dataytypes:
-- SELECT DATETIME():

-- if we want time in the milliseconds:
-- for that we can use the (current_timestamp):
-- means (timestamp) datatypes:
-- here (5) repesents the (5-digit) value of (milloseconds):

-- SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(5);
